================
1. Soften the Soybeans by soaking or boiling
	* Soak overnight, or
	* Boil for 20 minutes, and let sit in the water for two hours.
2. Split the soybeans with a food processor or potato masher
	* Put the soybeans into a big pot and mash them to split the beans in half and knock
	off the outer skin (you may need to do this in batches), or
	* Put the soybeans in a food processor with a dull plastic blade (one that just knocks them around). Then put the beans into a pot.
3. Put water in the pot and stir it around in a circular motion with your hand
4. Pour out the water slowly.  The skins will rise to the top and the beans will stay at the bottom.
	Place another bowl or a strainer in the sink in case you accidently pour out some beans.
5. Repeat until most of the skins are removed from the water

Ingredients
-----------
* 2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
 - maybe use a little flax too?
* 2 cups white sugar (maybe 1 1/2?)
* 3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 cup water
* 1 cup vegetable oil
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1/2 cup walnuts

Steps
------
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. In a large bowl, stir together the flour and water.
3. Add the sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt. Pour in vegetable oil and vanilla; mix until well blended. Spread evenly in a 9x13 inch baking pan.
4. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until the top is no longer shiny. Let cool for at least 10 minutes before cutting into squares.

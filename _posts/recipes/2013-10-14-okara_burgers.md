================

Ingredients
-----------
* 4 cloves of minced garlic
* about 1/2 cup of minced green onion
* 1/2 cup of minced red onion
* 1/2 cup of minced carrot
* about 2 tablespoons of olive oil
* a pinch of cayenne, a pinch of turmeric
* salt and fresh ground pepper
* 2 cups of okara
* about 1/2 cup of flaxmeal, amaranth, or rice flour
* about 1 cup of stale non-dairy bread crumbs

Steps
------
Start by mixing together your minced vegetables in a large frying pan, and saute them over medium heat with your olive oil until tender. Next, add in your spices and the okara, and mix thoroughly. Slowly add in your flax or amaranth - you may not even need the entire half cup - and cook the mixture for another couple minutes until relatively firm. Remove your mixture from the heat and allow it too cool for a minute or two. Feel free to be a little creative here with your veggies and spices - there's an infinite number of possibilities, and it's up to your palate to decide which way to go.

Next, preheat your oven to 350 and form your mixture into patties. Coat the outsides with your bread crumbs, and place on a lightly oiled cookie sheet, then bake for 10 minutes. Carefully flip each burger and cook for another ten, remove from the oven and cool. This recipe makes about eight good sized burgers. And if the weather's nice and you've got the urge to grill out, definitely go for it. Any burgers you don't end up eating can be frozen and re-grilled later. Just remember to use your okara within a day or two of extracting it from the soybeans, or freeze it, or toast it, or make it into bread. I'm telling you - there's a whole soy world out there.

Notes
-----
These were nice as burgers, but a bit bland. The okara is great for keeping the burgers together,
but maybe it would be better to use less okara and throw in some black beans and other veggies and spices.

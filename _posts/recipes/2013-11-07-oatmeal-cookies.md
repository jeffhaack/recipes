Ingredients

From sasha:

I have used this recipe as a base http://www.cookiemadness.net/2008/06/chewy-vegan-oatmeal-raisin-cookies/ . 
Of course you can use just all-purpose flour or any other flour; 
I think it's a good idea to reduce the flour and increase the oats instead a little bit; 
Apple sauce can be skipped; 
Instead of the sugars you can use 1/3 cup agave syrup or just use the brown sugar + more maple syrup. If you don't use apple sauce, agave syrup will probably be better than dry sugar, 'cause it will give some moisture. 
If you have ground flax seeds you can mix 1,5 tablespoon of it with 4 tablespoons of water and add it to the mixture. 
And of course I put twice as much cinnamon :) 
I baked it for just 10 minutes and it seemed just enough. 

Well, I'm sure can figure out you own perfect recipe!

Good luck and enjoy!

Целую,

Саша.

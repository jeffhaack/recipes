Ingredients
-----------

I will give you the basic risotto recipe.  From there you can mix in whatever you want.  As you probably know by now, my favorite is adding pesto, sundried tomatoes, and sauteed mushrooms.  However, you can use your own imagination.

Saute one small diced onion and 3 diced garlic cloves in two tbs of olive oil over medium heat for 3-5 minutes.

Stir in 1-2 cups of arborio rice.  Cook for 2 minutes, stirring and making sure it is well coated with the oil.

While this is going on, bring 2 or 3 cans (16oz) of chicken or vegetable broth to a boil, then reduce heat to low.

Stir 1 cup of dry white wine into the rice mixture, stirring almost continually.

After wine has absorbed (usually 3 to 5 minutes), start adding the broth 1/2 cup at a time.  Continue to stir and add more when broth is almost completely absorbed.  Keep adding the broth until the rice achieves desired texture.  If you run out of the broth, you can substitute warm water.

When the rice is done add your other ingredients.

Enjoy!

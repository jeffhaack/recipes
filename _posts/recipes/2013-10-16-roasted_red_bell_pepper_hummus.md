================

Ingredients
-----------
* 1 red bell pepper
* 16 oz (1 can) chickpeas
* serrano pepper (to taste)
* 3 cloves garlic
* 1 tsp hot paprika
* 1/2 tsp black pepper
* 3 tbsp lemon juice
* 2 tbsp tahini
* 3/4 tsp salt
* 1 tsp cumin
* 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper

Steps
------
Slice and broil the red bell peppers in the oven for 10 minutes, until the skins are blackened. The skins will peel off relatively easily.

Then blend together all the ingredients.

Notes
-----
This is my own recipe. It's not very thin, so thinking to add a can of Cannelini Beans next time. Could also add some water or olive oil, but I think beans would be better.

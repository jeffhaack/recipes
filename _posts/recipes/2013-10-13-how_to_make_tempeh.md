================

Ingredients
-----------
* 2 cups dry beans (or 6 cups soaked)
* 2 tbsp vinegar
* 3/4 tsp Tempeh Starter

Steps
------
1. Soak and dehull your soybeans.
2. Boil the dehulled beans for 30 minutes until cooked through.
3. Pour out the cooking water and dry the beans.
	* Heat the beans over a low heat to dry, and/or
	* Put the beans on a dry towel and pat them dry
4. Let the beans cool to room temperature.
5. Add vinegar and tempeh starter and mix well.
6. Place the beans in vented containers, such as plastic bags with pin-sized holes poked in them.
7. Incubante the beans at 88°F (31°C) for 36-48 hours.
8. Reduce external heat after 12 hours as the tempeh will start to generate its own heat.

Freezing Tempeh
---------------
If you wish to freeze the finished tempeh, steam the tempeh over boiling water for 20 minutes to cook then slice into patties and soak overnight in salt water (2 tsp salt to one pint water). The patties can then be patted dried and frozen for future use.

Note- When refrigerating or freezing it's important to initially store the tempeh in flat sheets because their internal heat production will allow them to continue fermenting if stacked. Store tempeh in the refrigerator tor up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 2 months. Makes about 2 ¼ pounds (1 kg) of tempeh.

Incubation Methods (Heat Sources) for Making Tempeh: 
----------------------------------------------------
Proper temperature is vital for the fermentation process. While a temperature range of 85-91ºF is technically acceptable, ideally the tempeh should ferment at 88ºF (31ºC). Regardless of which method you choose to keep your tempeh warm during the process, be sure to verify that the method you are using will achieve and maintain the proper temperature and check the temperature often during the process. Here are a few possible methods for maintaining the proper temperature:

* Large cube-shaped dehydrator (i.e., Excalibur or TSM Dehydrator)
* Oven with a low temperature setting or with just the light turned on (check the temperature of your oven first as ovens vary in heat)
* Cupboard with a low-level heat source (like a high-wattage light bulb)
* Styrofoam or plastic "cooler" with warm water bottles to maintain the heat
* Low-level mat such as those sold for reptiles (Pet Store) or to maintain spout seedlings (Gardening Store). Please note, these mats generally keep the tempeh about 10 degrees above the ambient temperature so they will still require a rather warm room.  This is not the same as a commercial heating pad which normally runs far too warm for this purpose
* Incubate outside if you live in a warm climate
* A warm part of your home during the summer months (e.g., a non-climate controlled attic, etc.)

================

Ingredients
-----------
* Olive Oil, for tossing
* Sweet potatoes, peeled and sliced into 1/4-inch long slices, then 1/4-wide inch strips, using a crinkle cut knife (optional)
* Paprika
* Cumin
* Salt
* Black Pepper
* Garlic Powder
* Dash of Cayenne

Steps
------
Pretty basic.  Preheat oven to 450 or even 500 for a crispier finish.
Cut the potatos and toss in oil, then coat in spices. Can adjust spices,
but this works pretty well. Great tasting, baked fries.

================

Ingredients
-----------
* 1 cup vegan mayonnaise
* 1/4 cup soy milk
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1 tsp onion powder
* 1/4 tsp black pepper
* 2 tsp fresh chopped parsley
* 1 tbsp cider vinegar
* 1/2 tsp fresh chopped dill or 1/4 tsp dried

Steps
------
Blend all ingredients in a blender or food processor until smooth and creamy.

To use your ranch dressing as a dip, just add a bit extra mayonnaise and a bit less soy milk to make it thicker. Place the dip in the fridge; dressing will thicken and set as it cools.

Enjoy your homemade vegan ranch dressing.

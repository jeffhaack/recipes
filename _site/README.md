OSM Warden
==========
* need to research, discuss topic with others

general idea is:
To create a system of monitoring, developing, and validating OpenStreetMap data in a way that maintains that democratic spirit of OSM.

So there will be a hierarchy of places, ie.
World
--Region/Continent
----Country
( From this point on I think it will be good to experiment with different methods, have different systems for different countries decided by the mappers there)
------Province/State/Administrative Region
--------County/District/etc.  these will be different based on different countries
----------made up neighborhood boundaries

Function (tabs) of this system will be
- Monitoring (monitor the data in an area, ie changes etc.)
- Planning
- Export
- Analytics (charts and graphs)
- Printouts and webmaps (according to various themes)


Map Studio
==========
a better online tileset designer ->
1) choose an area
2) select layers, layer tags
2.5) choose live data or not live data (mbtiles or some mapnik stuff)
3) edit in gui or with cartocss, like tilemill

- have icon sets
- save themes, reuse other peoples themes, etc.

host tiles like mapbox for $$
- half the price of mapbox
- provide same features, ie tileset upload
- also better online designer

Geo Geo Data
============
would be fun to take all the data i can get my hands on (jumpstart, crrc, etc. and
put together a bunch of stuff like this http://stateimpact.npr.org/maps/idaho/unemployment/#2012/February/Boundary
)
https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery
fun to play around with d3
